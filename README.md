# No Peaceful Mod

This is a Minecraft 1.16.1-Fabric mod.

## Background

As I have seen that some speedrunners accidentally switched their gamemode to peaceful, which caused their record to be invalid, I decide to write this no peaceful mod to prevent this from happening.

## Features

This mod replace the original difficulty button with a new button that cannot switch to peaceful mode.

Now the only way to switch to peaceful mode is by using commands.

## Warning

This mod is still a beta version, and yet has not been accepted by the speedrun official.
